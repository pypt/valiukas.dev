![OpenDict](/images/opendict-macos/opendict-mac-os-x.png)

My third stable release of [OpenDict](http://opendict.sourceforge.net/)'s port for macOS.


## Download

The version of OpenDict that's being used is OpenDict 0.6.2c. Download it from:

**<https://stuff.pypt.lt/opendict_macosx/opendict-led-0.6.2c.dmg>** (15.7 MB)

Alternatively, you can download <https://stuff.pypt.lt/opendict_macosx/opendict-0.6.2c.dmg> which does not include LED's dictionaries (12.8 MB).


## How to install

1. Download the installer image (see above)
2. Open the image
3. Drag the yellow *OpenDict* icon into your *Applications* folder
4. That's it! Should work by now.


## Changelog

* 1000+ downloads so far!
* *0.6.2c* - upgraded to 0.6.3 (or maybe still 0.6.2?), smaller image (uh oh, I found the Compress functionâ€¦), new copyright notices
* *0.6.2b* - recreated package with py2app, correct versions of Python/wxPython included, LED dictionaries as well, Preferences menu works again, everything's just perfect! ;-)
* *0.6.2* - first release
